Welcome to Nowhere to go!
In this strategy game two 
cutthroat spies are trying to 
corner each other. The 
gameboard is set up beforehand, 
with 19 pads. Each pad is connected 
to up to 6 adjacent pads via bridges.
If the bridge has a grey blocker 
on it, then you can't cross that 
bridge. On each of your turns, 
you first have to move. You can 
move to any space on the board 
such that,there is a path between 
the space you are currently in 
and that space that crosses open 
bridges and does not go through 
the pad where the other spy is.
After you move, you then need to 
place a blocker. You can place a 
blocker on any bridge on the board, 
provided that it doesn't already have
a blocker on it. The game continues 
until one player can't move, and thus loses.
The winner is entitled to mock the 
other player mercilessly.
